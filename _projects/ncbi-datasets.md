title: "Programatically downloading and curating NCBI genome dataset"
excerpt: "
<hr>
In this project, I harness the use of the Python language to programatically download whole genome assemblies from NCBI genome database.
<br>
I demonstrate in detail my methodology in:
<br>
    **1. Shortlisting a list of genome accessions from the taxonomic family of interest** <br>
    **2. Filtering this list against a specified set of conditions** <br>
    **3. Validating this list to retain only validly published organisms** <br>
    **4. Automating the download of whole genome assemblies** <br>
<br>
My complete workflow is documented in a single Jupyter Notebook; check it out <a href='https://github.com/shuaneryx/ncbi_datasets/blob/main/ncbi_datasets.ipynb' target='_blank'>here</a>!

The genome dataset showcased here is used in my description of a marine bacteria (**TLL-SE01**) from a novel genus, <a href='https://lpsn.dsmz.de/genus/parasalinivibrio' target='_blank'><i>Parasalinivibrio</i></a>, which I isolated from the intestinal contents of a farmed Asian Seabass (*Lates calcarifer*). I used this dataset in my downstream phylogenetic and taxonogenomic analysis of **TLL-SE01** together with all valid species from the family *Vibrionaceae*.
